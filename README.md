# x0xs3q

We are creating a standalone [x0xb0x](https://www.ladyada.net/make/x0xb0x/) s3quencer.   **Please contribute!**

The idea is a single circuit board with power, USB, MIDI, track/pattern, and the sequencer section of the original [x0xb0x](https://www.ladyada.net/make/x0xb0x/).  Embeddable into many styles of case, but targeting a 303 style case to start.

## Features / Goals
- Control other synths via MIDI out:
  - Starting with the [Behringer TD-3](https://www.google.com/search?q=behringer+td-3), or [midi enabled TB303](https://www.google.com/search?q=Roland+TB303+midi+mod)
  - Also support other mono synths ([SH-101](https://www.google.com/search?q=Roland+SH-101+midi+retrofit), etc)
- Select button mapping with a switch:
  - x0xb0x: the more intuitive style of interface found on the stock x0xb0x (which promotes intentional composition)
  - 303: the more difficult tb303 / td3 style interface (which promotes "happy accidents")
- Slim 303 case
  - in the style of original Roland TB303
  - so that putting the x0xb0x sequencer in front of a TB303 or TD-3 looks like it belongs as a natural extension
