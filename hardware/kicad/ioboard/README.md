# what's this

ladyada's original [x0xb0x](https://www.ladyada.net/make/x0xb0x/) mainboard and ioboard files were created with a version of EAGLE older than ver6.

EAGLE is now owned by autodesk, and is only available with FUSION 360 which costs money...

Let's use the excellent free/opensource KiCAD tool instead!

How we converted to KiCAD:
 - we loaded the original LadyAda mainboard and ioboard files into EAGLE 6 freeware, and saved.
 - we then imported the EAGLE6 files into KiCAD 5.1.2

enjoy
